# Community Advocate

The Community Advocate (CA) serves as the voice of our gaming community. This person is a volunteer who acts as a liaison between group organizers and individual group members who wish to raise concerns indirectly or while maintaining anonymity.

The goal of the CA is to help resolve issues and address concerns of/between group members in a way consistent with our [Community Standards](COMMUNITY_STANDARDS.md). As members of our community, the CAs are concerned about the welfare of our members and willing to take an active role in ensuring everyone is treated with dignity and respect while having a great time playing games together.

We aim to have one CA at every meet. Their nametag will be clearly marked with “(CA)”.

Interested in becoming a CA? See our [Community Advocate Guidelines](COMMUNITY_ADVOCATE_GUIDELINES.md), and give a shout to a group organizer if you think you'd be a good fit.
