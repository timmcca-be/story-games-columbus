# Community Advocate Guidelines

- Be kind and approachable
- Prepare to discuss difficult, sensitive topics
- Introduce yourself at the beginning of the event, and prominently mark your nametag with “(CA)”
- If somebody raises a concern to you:
  - Express sympathy and compassion
  - Clarify whether they would prefer for you to handle the matter anonymously, or if it is okay for group organizers to know who raised the concern
  - Let group organizers know, discreetly and as soon as reasonably possible
  - Keep the issue between yourself, the member who raised it, and group organizers
