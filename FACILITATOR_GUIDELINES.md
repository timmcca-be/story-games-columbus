# Facilitator Guidelines

## Before the event
- Avoid prep work for players. Anybody should be able to show up at your table and play with no advance knowledge or materials, and still have fun. Suggestions:
  - Pick a rules-light game. Something like D&D would be a bad choice, as you'd need to provide a ton of dice and your players would likely spend the whole session learning the rules. Think more along the lines of Fiasco, which requires minimal materials and can be learned in a few minutes.
  - If character creation is arduous, bring pre-built characters for your players.
- Coordinate on Discord the week before the event. If you are planning to run a game that covers sensitive topics, ensure someone is planning to run a lighter game so that we can include everybody.
- Take two index cards, and draw a big X on each of them. These are your X-cards; your players can conspicuously tap them or pick them up to signal that a story element has made them uncomfortable, so you can rewind and choose another path.
- Decide if and how you want to ask your players about their Lines and Veils. Lines are topics that are totally off-limits, and Veils are things that can happen off-screen but can't be a central part of the game (e.g. "fade to black"). You can ask for these aloud or have your players write them on cards and hand them to you. This is strongly encouraged for games that cover sensitive topics, and left to your discretion for lighter games.

## At the event
- Ensure that someone gives a quick overview of the community standards.
- When pitching your game, provide enough info for someone to decide whether they're interested. Specifically:
  - Concept
  - Tone: what's typical, and what are the options.
  - Subject matter: what sensitive topics tend to come up, and which are unavoidable.
- Once you sit down to play, run through CATS in more detail:
  - Concept: if it's worth elaborating, elaborate; otherwise just give a quick reminder of what you said before.
  - Aim: see doc
  - Tone: you gave the overview, so now it's time for the conversational part. Come to an agreement, and discuss a movie rating (PG, PG-13, R, etc.)
  - Subject matter: figure out what specifically is off-limits for your players. This is a good time to ask for Lines and Veils if you decided to do so.
- Set out the X-cards so that everyone can reach one, and explain their purpose.
- Have fun gaming! During the game:
  - Do your best to include everybody and give all players an opportunity to be heard, but don't force participation. Some players, especially those new to TTRPGs, are shy about engaging with the game, and you should let them warm up at their own pace.
  - Keep in mind that much of the responsibility of enforcing Lines and Veils falls to you. If you had players write down their Lines and Veils, then that responsibility falls solely to you, as the rest of the table doesn't know what they are. Handle it quickly and with minimal fanfare; e.g. "this is behind one of our Veils, so let's fade to black here and open up on the next scene" or "this crosses one of our Lines, so what do you want to do instead/do you want to ___ instead?"
- If a player violates the Community Standards in a way that isn't minor and easy for you to address at the table, let one of the group admins know. For serious or persistent violations, you may ask the player to leave the table.
