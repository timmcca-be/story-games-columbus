# Community Standards

1. **Welcome new members** with kindness and enthusiasm. This is a group for anyone interested in story games, first-timers and veterans alike.
2. **Keep an "open table" mindset**. Anyone is free to join or leave a game at any time, with or without explanation. 
3. **Respect everyone**. This means not doing or saying anything that is likely to make them uncomfortable, and listening if they say that your actions did upset them. Specifically,
    1. **Absolutely no harassment**: verbal, sexual, or otherwise.
    2. **Absolutely no hate speech**. In other words, do not express hate or suggest violence against anybody based on their marginalized identities.
    3. **Use the correct name and pronouns**. This means what is on their name tag or what they told you to use.
    4. **Respect the privacy of others**. Don't press people to share personal or contact information.
4. **Invite and include everybody's creative input**.
5. **Respect everybody's bounds**. Don't explore topics that anyone at the table is uncomfortable with, and don't ask them to explain their discomfort.
